## ðŸ“– Project Overview
The classical Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) for blind beamforming is formulated as a **non-convex quartic optimization problem**, making it prone to local minima.  
The referenced paper introduces a **convex reformulation** using matrix lifting and nuclear norm relaxation, ensuring global optimality and enabling additional linear constraints.

In this project, we:
- Implement the convex CMA and LCCMA formulations in **Python (CVXPY)**.  
- Generate synthetic array snapshots (QPSK desired signal, Gaussian interferers, noise) to test the approach.  
- Evaluate beamforming performance in terms of output power and interference rejection.  
- Explore possible improvements and extensions to the convex relaxation.
